# buddypress-xprofile-member-type-field
It allows to create a xProfile field that selects only one of the member types defined

It creates a new field type, called Member Type, that you can use to create a new field to add in the Base Group.
During the registration it assign automatically the member type at the user.
Member type cannot be changed after registration (itâ€™s a feature, not a bug).
