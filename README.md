Member Type Field for Buddypress XProfile
============

This Wordpress plugin allows to create a xProfile field that selects only one of the member types defined in Buddypress.

Requires Buddypress 2.2 or later.

Instructions
============

Install the plugin as usual. This creates a new xProfile field type, called Member Type, that you can use to create a new field to add in the Base Group.
Just go to Profile Fields (/wp-admin/users.php?page=bp-profile-setup), add a new field and then select the Member Type from the drop down list:

When a new user will register, he/she will have the opportunity to select his/her own member type:

How it works
============
During the registration it assigns automatically the member type at the user.
Member type cannot be changed after registration (itâ€™s a feature, not a bug).
To create and manage member types, refers to the codex (add url here) or install the plugin [BuddyPress Member Type generator](http://buddydev.com/plugins/bp-member-type-generator/)
